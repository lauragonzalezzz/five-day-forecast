# five-day-forecast

## Sign up for an APPID (APIKEY)

1. Sign up for an account to get your **API KEY** [http://openweathermap.org/API](http://openweathermap.org/API)
2. [Read the Documentation for getting a 5-Day weather forecast](http://openweathermap.org/forecast5)

## Project Set-up
Your project directory should look like:

```bash
public
├── css
│  └── styles.css
├── index.html
└── js
    ├── client.js
    └── open_weather.js (this is for the stretch goal of making a module)
```

notes: `css`, `index.html` and `js` directories are all siblings and located **inside of `public/`** of your project.

## Goal (MVP)
There should be an input field where the User is able to input a city's name. Once the city name has been entered, there should be a button to trigger the XHR request to get a 5-day weather forecast data from OpenWeather. Display the data the best you can.

You can use **must vanilla javascript xhr**.

**use git, commit often!**
